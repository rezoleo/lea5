# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

en:
  hello: "Hello world"
  number:
    currency:
      format:
        # Delimits thousands (e.g. 1,000,000 is a million) (always in groups of three)
        delimiter: " "
        # Where is the currency sign? %u is the currency unit, %n is the number (default: $5.00)
        format: "%n %u"
        # Number of decimals, behind the separator (the number 1 with a precision of 2 gives: 1.00)
        precision: 2
        # Sets the separator between the units, for more precision (e.g. 1.0 / 2.0 == 0.5)
        separator: ","
        # If set to true, precision will mean the number of significant digits instead
        # of the number of decimal digits (1234 with precision 2 becomes 1200, 1.23543 becomes 1.2)
        significant: false
        # If set, the zeros after the decimal separator will always be stripped (e.g.: 1.200 will be 1.2)
        strip_insignificant_zeros: false
        unit: "€"
