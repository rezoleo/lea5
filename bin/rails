# Load Simplecov as early as possible, to ensure code coverage is correctly generated.
# Rails discovers all test/**/*_test.rb files and loads them in order, this in turn loads
# test_helper.rb, which finally requires simplecov.
# However, at that point it is too late, as the first test has been required and its
# coverage cannot be extracted.
# By requiring simplecov just as we run the `rails test` command, we can instrument Ruby
# before the first test is even loaded.
# Inspired by https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov#getting-started where they suggest
# editing `bin/rails`.
